    <h1>Cat pics.</h1>
    
      Cats are next to the dogs the most popular pet in the world.
    <br>
      I'm not allowed to keep a cat myself, because my mom is allergic to them.
    <br>
    Thats's why I'm writing a page about all the cute cat pics I've found on the internet. Have fun!
